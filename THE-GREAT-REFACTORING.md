# The Great Refactoring

## What happened here

I looked at this codebase and knew it needed work. Like, a lot of work. The map file was over 1000 lines of the same stuff repeated over and over. Files were massive. Everything was mixed together.

So I fixed it.

## The damage report

### Before
- game-map.js was 1000+ lines of repetitive json
- bulkgamelogic.js was one giant file trying to do everything  
- HTML files had CSS and JavaScript all mixed in
- No real folder structure
- The mincoins builder was 485 lines in one file

### After  
- game-map.js is now ~100 lines using a simple array format
- Everything is split into modules that make sense
- CSS lives in CSS files, JS lives in JS files
- Proper folder structure with game-engine/, mincoins/, and build-with-gui/
- MinCoins builder split into 4 focused files

## The big wins

**Map data went from this mess:**
```javascript
{
  "tile": "Grass 1",
  "file": "grass1.jpeg", 
  "rotation": 0
},
{
  "tile": "Grass 1",
  "file": "grass1.jpeg",
  "rotation": 0  
},
// ... 1000 more times
```

**To this:**
```javascript
['g1', 'g1', 'g1', 'monastery', ['roadH', 90], 'g2']
```
YAAAY functions
90% smaller. Actually readable. You can edit it by hand without losing your mind.

## What I learned

Refactoring this much code is like untangling christmas lights. You pull one thread and suddenly you're restructuring everything. But it's worth it because now:

- I can actually find stuff
- Adding new features won't break everything
- Other people might actually understand this code
- The map maker exports the new compact format

The best part? The game still works exactly the same. Users won't notice anything different. But for anyone working on this code, it's night and day.

## The map maker revolution

The Carcassonne map maker was outputting 1000+ lines of verbose JSON. Now when you export, you get clean readable code that anyone can use. No more endless scrolling through repetitive data.

The MinCoins builder got some love too - added a hammer sprite for navigation and split the massive 485 line file into organized modules.

## Files touched
Pretty much all of them. But the main carnage:
- Split bulkgamelogic.js into ~10 files
- Rewrote game-map.js completely  
- Separated all the CSS from HTML
- Created proper module structure
- Updated the Carcassonne map maker to output compact data
- Split MinCoins builder into modules and added hammer navigation

This was a lot of work. My brain is tired. But the code is so much better now.
