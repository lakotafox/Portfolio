    <h1>AI: A Scalpel Not A Hammer</h1>

        "It's a scalpel not a hammer."
    </div>

    <p>That's actually a quote from my good friend Rod Buhler. He's a professor at my college, teaches inside the prison, and stops in at Hill Air Force Base to help them stay sharp on cybersecurity. So yeah, total genius. He's the kind of ethical hacker we all strive to be as junior devs. He taught me something so simple, but it completely changed my life. It started with how I use tools, specifically the lightbulb hints in NetBeans. He made sure I understood why I shouldn't just spam them like a hammer, but to use them like a scalpel, carefully, intentionally, thoughtfully, with deep consideration. And before even going there, read the code.</p>

    <p>Then I realized I was treating AI and the internet the same way people treat cheap power tools. point, click, FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, It worked, Today it may work but it is lazy."Just because you can doesn't mean you should. A simple project can easily turn into fifty thousand lines that smells off.I have been there I think a lot of us have abusing Claude GPT or copilot or even google. But if we want to be truly successfully we need to use these tools as a scalpel not a hammer.Some prompts may take three hours. Not because the AI is slow, but because I need to do the work. I have to read. Not just my code but everything and write it out comprehensively specifically in a way that doesn't generate illegible code you must be logical when using a power tool you cant just swing it around go and read, lookup GitHub threads, documentation, blog posts, and professional articles explaining how experienced developers solve the same problems. That's when AI becomes a scalpel. Fast, sharp, precise. An excellent tool that can seriously help and kick ass.</p>

    <p>Claude's my main AI tool, even more useful to me than ChatGPT for writing GPT is Like Stack Overflow, but on fast forward. You can dump huge projects into it and just say "fix it." That was the hammer way. or treat it how rod treats his lightbulbs. Only use it when I know what the problem is and logically and make sure the bot does too you really shouldn't be typing small unclean prompts be literate in English as well as your programing and logical explanations of what you want or don't want, what's wrong or what you want to achieve. Because you I don't, your just building something I you don't even know how to maintain.It's like crawling with a power tool in your hand.</p>

    <p>For example, I made a Tic Tac Toe game. It worked. Cool, great. But when I tried to improve it, I went full hammer mode. I asked for a bunch of features and I got them. It looked great and it worked. But also it was a complete mess. I couldn't read it, and neither could you. Maybe you could, I'm still learning. But to me it was some pure bot code. Totally unguided chaos. So many imports. So many weird logic pieces. The code became spaghettified. It worked, yeah, but I couldn't explain how it worked anymore. And if I can't explain it, what happens when I want to add more features later? I guess I just smash the hammer again. Or what if someone else reads it? Or get this, what if another AI tries to help and gets confused too? That's not some sci-fi joke. That's real. AI "reads" too. If your code is a tangled mess, even the bots get stuck in it. Bloated code kills projects and you can't smash the bloat back in with a hammer.</p>

    <div class="tictactoe-buttons">
        <button class="demo-btn" onclick="openTicTacToe('messy')">View Messy TicTacToe ðŸ”¨</button>
        <button class="demo-btn" onclick="openTicTacToe('clean')">View Clean TicTacToe ðŸ”ª</button>
    </div>

    <p>We live in a time where "if it works, it works" isn't good enough anymore. Tools like Claude, GPT, GitHub Copilot, whatever, are getting more powerful every day. That's great but also dangerous. Because if you're not steering the ship, the ship will crash. And maybe even lead to mutiny. That's why I say scalpel not hammer. You're still the captain. You're still the developer. These tools don't think for you. They don't have taste. And the humans don't even match your taste either. They and the bots don't know what you want unless you do first. We have to be specific and come to the table prepared. Don't be afraid to step away for one hour, two hours, even forty hours so you can read up and get up to date with concepts or your own code. This is an excellent time to go back to pen and paper, maybe some flowcharting, take a walk, do what you have to do. Just don't smash a hammer on your house of cards.</p>

    <p>And yeah, I still love Stack Overflow. I still Google errors. I still read books and weird Reddit threads about obscure C plus plus memory issues. AI is just another part of the mix now. It's a tool like the others. But it's powerful. So if you let it think instead of you, you stop growing. I am growing. I want to write readable code. I want to build things I understand and can explain. I want my AI to help me learn, not just do. Because I know where the other path leads. I've seen it. You end up with broken projects, unreadable code, and zero ownership. That's not me.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Rod, Claude, bugs, errors, GitHub issues, Stack Overflow legends and jerksâ€¦ (don't use rm- rf to fix it ), and some painful late-night debugging that produced more bugs than it fixed, I've changed how I see this stuff truly. AI is not a crutch. It's not a magic wand. It's a scalpel.</p>
