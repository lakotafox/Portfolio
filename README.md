## THE CRAZY PART

## Before I explain the parts of the project let me explain my devlopment process.

## Creating the Visual Builders 

Both the map-maker and MinCoins builder are tools were developed through an iterative process with AI assistance. Creating functional GUI builders required multiple attempts and careful step-by-step development:

### My Process..... as a jerry who knows some but not all, hopfully enough 



1. **Initial Attempts**: Started with basic canvas rendering and mouse interaction 

"claude make a enviorment where I can paint my own map yours aint workin out I need an array of my tiles and the abilty to select and paint with each...!!

this did not work out but built some sort of foundation of an "Enviorment" I could then prompt again to refine and build upon 


2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Figured tiles that could be dragged onto the canvas would be simple and a good base to start 



3. **Interaction Refinement**: DEEP REFINEING prompted for different mouse actions:
   - Single click for selection/deletion
   - Click to selcet tile and click to place in grid 
   - Double-click for editing
   - sidebar with tiles 
   - a tool to rotate tiles 


4. **Data Export**: I made the map and then dug through inspect element and gave the wrong code like 15 times............. then prompted hey  create a button that opens a window with the exact code(JSON) I needed to add to my main portfolio for its map.functionality to generate clean data structures
GO LOOK AT game-map.js ..... IT IS GIANT... 




**I KNOW OKAY**
this may seem dumb and extra or it may seem genius and inovative up to you 



#### Key Challenges Solved
- **Map Maker**: Data collecting with GUI 
( lame or cool? ). getting rotation to work proper in carc map builder 
see carcasonecentral.com for tile logic  
 
 HA JOKE Some tiles you say rotate left and it goes right lol its bugged it's in game-map.js

- **MinCoins Builder**: Same idea as map builder managing different interaction modes click double click  (delete vs drag vs resize) this has bugs too needs work 

- **Both Tools**: Making the export format match what the games expect using a game like enviorment to build my game like enviorment AWESOME! 


## Thats weird
 what the heck is this guy doing




## THE BUILDER TOOLS


## Carc Map Creation

The game map is stored in `build-with-gui/carc-map-mkr/output/exported-map-compact.js` as a compact array format.

**DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND!**

**I mean you can... but there is another way perhaps ;)** PLEASE JUST TRY IT 

### THE GREAT REFACTOR UPDATE:
We optimized the map data from 1000+ lines down to just 89 lines! 

**Map data went from this mess:**
```javascript
{
  "tile": "Grass 1",
  "file": "grass1.jpeg", 
  "rotation": 0
},
{
  "tile": "Grass 1",
  "file": "grass1.jpeg",
  "rotation": 0  
},
// ... 1000 more times
```

**To this:**
```javascript
['g1', 'g1', 'g1', 'monastery', ['roadH', 90], 'g2']
```

YAAAY functions! ðŸŽ‰
- 90% smaller file size
- Actually readable by humans
- You can edit it by hand without losing your mind
- An expansion function at runtime converts compact â†’ verbose
- Same exact functionality, just smarter storage!

To modify the map:
1. Open `build-with-gui/carc-map-mkr/map-maker.html` in your browser
2. Use the visual editor to:
   - Drag tiles from the palette to the canvas
   - Click tiles to rotate them (0Â°, 90Â°, 180Â°, 270Â°)
   - Right-click to delete tiles
3. Click "Export Map" button
4. Copy the generated data and paste it into `exported-map-compact.js`

The map-maker tool was built with AI assistance to create a visual way to design Carcassonne-style tile layouts.








## Project Files Organization

All portfolio projects are now organized in the `/projects` folder:

Each project is self-contained with its own HTML, CSS, JS, and assets.

## Project Marker Tool

**DO NOT EDIT PROJECT LOCATIONS BY HAND!**

To modify where projects appear on the map:
1. Open `build-with-gui/project-marker/input/project-marker.html` in your browser
2. Use the visual editor to:
   - Click on city tiles to place project markers
   - Right-click to remove projects
   - Double-click to edit project details
   - Use WASD keys to navigate the map
3. Click "Export Projects Array" button
4. Copy the generated data and paste it into `game-engine/projects/projects-global.js`

The project marker tool allows you to visually place projects on the Carcassonne map and export the data for the portfolio.

## Portfolio project Editor Just min coins for now..

**DO NOT EDIT THE LAYOUT DATA BY HAND!**

**I mean... you can...** :( 

To modify the MinCoins area layout:
1. Open `mincoins/mincoins-builder-simple.html` in your browser

2. Use the visual editor to:
   - Drag signs, terminals, and buttons from the palette
   - Single click to delete items
   - Click and hold to drag items
   - Drag corners to resize
   - Double-click to edit text
   - Use WASD keys to move the view

3. Click "Export JSON" button (Opens window with code)

4. Copy the generated items array and paste it into the `layoutItems` array in `mincoins/mincoins-area.html`

5. some buggs like the drag and drop is off center the bot has no eyes so...

MinCoins builder tool allows you to create interactive programming environments with:
- Signs for guidance to terminal and viewing code
- Terminal window for program output
- Run button to start the program
- Number keys (0-9) for input
- Enter key to submit input
